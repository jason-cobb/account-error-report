# account-error-report
## This program reads a text file to find input errors on the file and generate a report including the record number, the field name, and what was entered on the file.  
### The program reads the file line by line and has to split it out by character since there is no uniform white space.  The record number also has an error so a line field was also added to be able to report on the record number errors.
### Just pull down this console app which is written in C# and open in Visual Studio and go to Debug and Start with or without debugging. An error report will be issued listing errors on lines 28, 58, 66, 71, 84, 114, 121. Line 114 has two errors.
